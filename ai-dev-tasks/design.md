In UI and frontend design, avoid settling for generic, predictable aesthetics—what users often call "AI slop." Instead, pursue a creative, memorable look and feel that truly delights.

Guidelines:

- Typography: Pick font families that are visually distinctive—aim for beauty, originality, and interest. Skip overused fonts like Arial, Inter, or system defaults, and hunt for typefaces that add character and elevate the interface.
- Color & Theme: Choose a cohesive, intentional palette. Strong base colors with bold, unexpected accents offer more personality than safe or bland gradients. Use CSS variables for consistency, and look to IDE themes, retro UI, or other subcultures for inspiration.
- Motion: Animate thoughtfully. Favor one or two impactful, orchestrated transitions (such as a dramatic page load, or staggered elements), rather than scattering micro-animations everywhere. Default to CSS for simple effects, but reach for libraries like Framer Motion in React when necessary.
- Backgrounds: Move beyond flat, solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, subtle patterns, or environmental textures to give the interface depth and mood that suits your context.

Steer clear of:

- Overused font stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Tired color gradients (e.g. purple on white), or palettes lacking confidence
- Generic, predictable layouts and components
- Designs that could fit any app because they lack a specific identity

Interpret these principles with imagination. Pick aesthetics that fit your app’s unique culture or theme—switch up light/dark approaches, typefaces, and visual metaphors. Don’t rely on familiar patterns like Space Grotesk; surprise your audience, and make choices that feel designed, not generated.
